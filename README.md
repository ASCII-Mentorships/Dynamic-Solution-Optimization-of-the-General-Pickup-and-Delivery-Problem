# Dynamic-Solution-Optimization-of-the-General-Pickup-and-Delivery-Problem

Project idea: We will work on the basic principles of the General Pickup and Delivery Problem while optimizing and tuning various parameters, introducing new possible variables to derive solutions to real world problems as well as come up with optimized algorithms to such problems. 

Domain of project: Research
Prerequisite (if any) - skills, software: Some Python programming experience and a research mindset.
